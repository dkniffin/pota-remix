# Princes of the Apocalypse Remix

This repo is home to a project that aims to rewrite, improve and expand upon the Princes of the Apocalypse campaign for 5e Dungeons and Dragons.

## How Can I Use It?

Currently, the project is still very much a work in progress. We have not decided yet what formats we'll distribute this rewrite in, but there will likely at least be a website. We plan to use [Homebrewery]'s styles in conjunction with a library such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

To follow the changes being made here, you can click "Watch" in the top right and you'll get notifications based on the preferences in your Github account.

## Campaign Markdown

The text for the campaign is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Contributing

All ideas and contributions to this project are welcome!

If you'd like to share an idea, please do so in the form of a Github Issue:

- Click the "Issues" tab up above
- Search for some key words to see if someone has already suggested your idea
- If they have suggested your idea, add a üëç reaction to the initial post, as a sort of informal vote for that idea. Alternatively, join in the conversation and provide your thoughts and feedback
- If you can't find an issue that matches your idea, click "New issue" to create a new one. Add as much detail as it takes to get your idea across. The posts are created using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), so feel free to include supporting images, links to spots in the campaign markdown, or whatever else you feel is necessary.

If your idea is detailed enough that you'd like to provide it in the form of a change to the campaign markdown, you can create a pull request. However, before doing so, it's probably a good idea to create a Github issue first, to make sure everyone else is onboard with your idea. To create a pull request:
